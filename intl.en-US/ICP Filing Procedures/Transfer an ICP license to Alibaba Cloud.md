# Transfer an ICP license to Alibaba Cloud {#concept_n4f_krl_zdb .concept}

If your website domain name has been ICP filed through another service provider and now your website is hosted by an Alibaba Cloud server, you must transfer your ICP Filing license to Alibaba Cloud.

Two types of ICP license transfer:

-   [Transfer an ICP Filing](#section_ss5_rrz_zdb): the ICP Filing subject has never filed through the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system.
-   [Transfer another ICP Filing](#section_int_j5z_zdb): the ICP Filing subject has filed through Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system before.

If you no longer use the Alibaba Cloud server to host your website, you must cancel the [ICP Filing transfer](#section_ugl_tvz_zdb).

**Note:** 

-   Transferring an existing ICP Filing license, you only add Alibaba Cloud as your service provider. The other filed information remains unchanged.

-   Your ICP Filing data at previous service provider is not affected. You can use the servers of both service providers.

-   You must follow the local [ICP Filing regulations](https://beian.aliyun.com/#MapDataContainer).

-   If the subject information has been filed with Alibaba Cloud and you want to transfer a website domain name of this subject filed through another service provider to Alibaba Cloud, you must log on to the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system with the Alibaba Cloud account with which you submitted your old ICP Filing application.  If you are a HiChina ICP Filing platform user, you must import your ICP Filing information from the  HiChina ICP Filing platform to Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system first. For more information about HiChina platform, see [ICP Filing system FAQs](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/48581.html).

-   After successful transfer, if your contact information is changed, you must modify the ICP Filing contact information.

    -   If the local administration requires domain name certificates, contact your domain name provider for your domain name certificates.
    If you file with the communications administration of Guangdong, Chongqing, Liaoning, Anhui, and Fujian, you can use Alibaba Cloud app to upload documents and verify the website administrator. For more information, see [Document uploading FAQs](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/Document uploading FAQs.md#).

    After you submit your ICP Filing information for Alibaba Cloud review, make sure that your phone number is in service and the call is answered during the normal working hours in China. If we find any problem , we contact you by the phone number in your ICP Filing information.

7.  After your information passes Alibaba Cloud review, log on to the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/selfBaIndex.htm) to upload a picture of the website administrator as required for verification.

    **Note for Shanghai users:**  Shanghai Communications Administration requires that ICP Filing applicants in Shanghai  **must** use Shanghai Communications Administration app \(only available in Chinese\) to verity the website administrator. For more information, see [Using Shanghai communications administration app to verify the website administrator](reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Using Shanghai Communications Administration app to verify the website administrator.md#).

    For other regions, ICP applicants can select one of several designated places, which are scattered in most major cities in China, to take an official photo as part of the application process. This rule demands the applicants to physically present in China long enough to have a picture taken. However, Alibaba Cloud can make it easier. You can apply for an official background \(that is, “photo backdrop”\) from the document uploading page of your ICP Filing process. Click **Enter Your Address**, and enter an address in mainland China. Alibaba Cloud can mail the photo backdrop to any region in mainland China. The website administrator takes a picture in front of the backdrop and upload the picture. Do not wear in red or blue when taking the picture.

    For more information, see [Website administrator verification FAQs](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/Website administrator verification FAQs.md#section_tb4_cht_zdb).

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/14196/15395712835688_en-US.png)

    After receiving eligible pictures and approving your application, Alibaba Cloud submits the application to the communications administration for approval. You are notified by an email and a text message.

8.  Verify the mobile phone number of the subject and website administrators. Currently, mobile phone verification is supported in Tianjin, Gansu, Tibet, Ningxia, Hainan, Xinjiang, and Qinghai. Other provinces do not require mobile phone number verification.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/14196/15395712845690_en-US.jpg)

    If you apply for ICP Filing in these regions, you will receive a text message \(in Chinese\) from the MIIT in five minutes after you get a notification from Alibaba Cloud.

    **You must follow the message to verify your mobile phone number within 48 hours. If you have not finish the verification in 48 hours, your ICP Filing application will be rejected.**
