After your PSB filing is successful, you must log on to the [Internet Security Administration Service Platform of the National Public Security Bureau of China](http://www.beian.gov.cn/portal/index) \(available in Chinese only\) .

## Handle illegal information {#section_xpx_qzt_zdb .section}

Carefully read and follow the rules and regulations mentioned on the [PSB Filing website](http://www.beian.gov.cn/portal/index) .

According to Chinese regulations governing PSB Filing, any illegal information presented on any websites must be immediately removed.  Once illegal information is detected on a website hosted in an Alibaba Cloud instance, Alibaba Cloud notifies the client to remove the illegal information. If the client does not respond, the service is suspended without any refund.

Alibaba Cloud suspends the website services without any refund in the following cases:

-   If a website is found to involve illegal information and violate the rule of posting illegal information for more than three times within 24 hours, Alibaba Cloud notifies the website owner by phone of the website shutdown and instance service suspension without any refund.

-   If the client cannot be contacted within one hour after the illegal information is detected, the website is suspended and cannot resume service for 12 hours.  If such situation occurs for three times, Alibaba Cloud suspends the client’s service without any refund.

-   If the client has provided false information during PSB Filing \(for example, fake phone number or email address\), Alibaba Cloud shuts down the client’s website and suspends the client’s service without any refund.

-   If the client does not delete the illegal information after receiving the phone call from Alibaba Cloud, Alibaba Cloud shuts down the website and suspends the client’s service without any refund.
