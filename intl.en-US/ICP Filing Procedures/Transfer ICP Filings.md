# Transfer ICP Filings {#concept_n4f_krl_zdb .concept}

If you have filed a website domain name ICP Filing through another service provider, you must transfer this application to Alibaba Cloud web hosting or set Alibaba Cloud as your server provider.

Alibaba Cloud provides two types of ICP Filing transfer:

-   [Transfer an external ICP Filing](#section_ss5_rrz_zdb): The ICP Filing subject has never been filed through the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing
-   [Continue to transfer an ICP Filing](#section_int_j5z_zdb): The ICP Filing subject was filed through the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system.

## Note {#section_l4p_2f3_r2b .section}

-   When you transfer an existing ICP Filing to Alibaba Cloud, Alibaba Cloud is added as a service provider. You cannot modify the filed information during the transfer.
-   Your ICP Filing data with the previous service provider is unaffected. You can use both service provider servers.
-   You must follow the local [ICP Filing regulations](https://beian.aliyun.com/#MapDataContainer) when entering the filing information and uploading the required documents.
-   If you have submitted an ICP Filing subject to Alibaba Cloud, but want to transfer the subject's domain name from another service provider to Alibaba Cloud, log on to the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system using the account that submitted the initial ICP Filing and update your submission to include the domain name.
-   If you use the HiChina ICP Filing platform, you need to import your ICP Filing information to the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system first. For more information about the importing procedures, see [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system FAQs](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/48581.html).
-   If you change the filing subject or the website administrator after the ICP Filing transfer is completed, update the filing information in time.

## Continue to transfer an ICP Filing {#section_int_j5z_zdb .section}

3.  For next steps, see [Transfer an external ICP Filing](#section_ss5_rrz_zdb).

**Note:** 

-   After your ICP Filing information passes the communications administration review, it will take a while to upload the reviewed information to the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system.
-   During this period, you can check for website vulnerabilities and block malicious attackers. You can also check website content to avoid the risks of being shut down and blacklisted by the MIIT for not abiding to Chinese content law.
