# Change ICP Filing information {#concept_ifp_jrl_zdb .concept}

You have obtained an ICP Filing license with your domain name and identifications, and you want to change the information of the subject or a website. When you are modifying your ICP Filing information, your website can be accessed as normal.

**Note:** 

-   Before you modify your ICP Filing information, read the  **ICP Filing change rules** in the local [ICP Filing rules](https://icpbeian.aliyun.com/#MapDataContainer) \(in Chinese\),  and make sure that you follow the rules.
-   You cannot change the province where your ICP Filing is registered. If you want to change the province, you must cancel the ICP Filing and apply for a new ICP Filing from the new province administration.
-   Some provincial and municipal authorities do not permit ICP Filing information changes.  In this case, you must cancel the ICP Filing and apply for a new ICP Filing. 
-   If you use a new domain name to replace the old one, you cannot visit the website with the old domain name after the new domain name is approved by the communications administration.
-   You cannot modify your ICP Filing information if you have another ICP Filing order in process. If you have another ICP Filing order in process, the buttons are not displayed.

## Procedure {#section_rw2_bnz_zdb .section}

1.  Log on to the [ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/) \(only available in Chinese\). On the homepage, you can view successfully filed records.
2.  Click **Modify Subject Information** or **Modify Website Information** to edit the ICP subject information or website information.

    -   Modify subject information: If you want to modify the information of the ICP Filing subject, the new information must also meet the requirements of the local administration.
    -   Modify website information: Modify the website information according to your actual situation.

        **Note:** From 00:00 January 1, 2018,  the relevant provincial/municipal authorities perform domain name verification to all submitted ICP Filing applications. MIIT has published requirements for domain name verification. For more information, see [Domain name information verification](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/Domain name information verification.md#).

    If you cannot find the related button, the reason may be that:

    -   you have another ICP Filing in progress that uses your ICP Filing information.  Different types of ICP Filing cannot be processed at the same time.
    -   The local administration does not allow information modification. In this case, you must cancel the ICP Filing first and apply for an ICP Filing again.

    After you submit your information and documents,  Alibaba Cloud will review your information and documents in one workday. After you submit your ICP Filing information for Alibaba Cloud review, make sure that your phone number is in service and the call is answered during the normal working hours in China. If we find any problem , we contact you by the phone number in your ICP Filing information.

5.  After your information passes Alibaba Cloud review, log on to the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/selfBaIndex.htm) to upload a picture of the website administrator as required for verification.

    **Note for Shanghai users: ** Shanghai Communications Administration requires that ICP Filing applicants in Shanghai **must** use Shanghai Communications Administration app \(only available in Chinese\) to verity the website administrator.  For more information, see [Using Shanghai communications administration app to verify the website administrator](reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Using Shanghai Communications Administration app to verify the website administrator.md#).

    For other regions, ICP applicants can select one of several designated places, which are scattered in most major cities in China, to take an official photo and upload the photo for verification as part of the application process. This rule demands the applicants to physically present in China long enough to have a picture taken. However, Alibaba Cloud can make it easier. You can apply for an official background \(that is, “photo backdrop”\) from the document uploading page of your ICP Filing process. Click **Enter Your Address**, and enter an address of mainland China.  Alibaba Cloud can mail the photo backdrop to any region in mainland China. The website administrator takes a picture in front of the backdrop and upload the picture. Do not wear in red or blue when taking the picture.

    For more information, see [Website administrator verification FAQs](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/Website administrator verification FAQs.md#section_tb4_cht_zdb).

    Alibaba Cloud submits your information for the local communications administration review in one workday after you upload acceptable picture.

6.  Verify the mobile phone number of the subject and website administrators. Currently, mobile phone verification is supported in  Tianjin, Gansu, Tibet, Ningxia, Hainan, Xinjiang, and Qinghai. Other provinces do not require mobile phone number verification.

    If you apply for ICP Filing in these regions, you will receive a text message \(in Chinese\) from the MIIT in five minutes after you get a message and an email from Alibaba Cloud.

    **You must follow the message to verify your mobile phone number within 48 hours. If you have not finish the verification in 48 hours, your ICP Filing application will be rejected**.

    For more information about mobile phone number verification, see [Mobile phone number verification for ICP Filing](reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Mobile phone number verification for ICP Filing.md#).


The local communications administration may take 3 to 20 workdays to review your ICP Filing information.。

The review result is sent to you by a text message and an email. You can view your ICP Filing status on the [ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/index) .
