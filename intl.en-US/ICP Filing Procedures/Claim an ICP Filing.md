1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing System](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/selfBaIndex.htm) \(only available in Chinese\).
2.  Enter the information of the ICP Filing subject and the filed domain name.

    The system automatically identifies whether your domain name and the subject information have been filed, and then displays the filing type.
