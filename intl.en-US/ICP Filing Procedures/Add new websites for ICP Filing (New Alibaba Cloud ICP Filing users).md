# Add new websites for ICP Filing \(New Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing users\) {#concept_ohv_krl_zdb .concept}

If your identification documents are filed with the MIIT through service providers other than Alibaba Cloud,  and now you use an Alibaba Cloud ECS instance to host your new website, the new website domain name must be ICP filed with Alibaba Cloud.

## Procedure {#section_qjh_4yz_zdb .section}

1.  Log on to the [ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/) \(only available in Chinese\).
2.  Enter **the new domain name and subject information which has been recorded in the MIIT system** and click **Verify Filing Type**.

3.  Verify your Alibaba Cloud ECS instance.

    For **Product Type**, select **Alibaba Cloud** and verify the instance by an ICP Filing service code. You can apply for an ICP Filing service code on ICP No. Application page of the Alibaba Cloud console. For more information about ICP Filing service code application, see [Apply for ICP Filing service codes](reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Apply for ICP Filing service codes.md#).

    For assistance, see [Document uploading FAQs](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/Document uploading FAQs.md#section_cfv_rbt_zdb).

7.  After Alibaba Cloud review, the website administrator must take a picture as required and upload it for further verification.

    You can apply for an Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing backdrop on the Photo page. The website administrator takes a picture in front of the backdrop and upload the picture. Do not wear in red or blue when taking the picture.

    Note for Shanghai users: Shanghai Communications Administration requires that ICP Filing applicants in Shanghai must use Shanghai Communications Administration app \(Available in Chinese only\)  to verity the website administrator.  For more information, see  [Using Shanghai Communications Administration app to verify the website administrator](reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Using Shanghai Communications Administration app to verify the website administrator.md#).

8.  Verify the mobile phone number of the subject and website administrators. Currently, mobile phone verification is required for users in Tianjin, Gansu, Tibet, Ningxia, Hainan, Xinjiang, and Qinghai. Other provinces do not require mobile phone number verification.

    If you apply for ICP Filing in these regions,  you will receive a text message \(in Chinese\) from the MIIT in five minutes after you get a message and an email from Alibaba Cloud.

    **You must follow the message to verify your mobile phone number within 48 hours.  If you have not finish the verification in 48 hours, your ICP Filing application will be rejected**.

    For more information about mobile phone number verification, see [Mobile phone number verification for ICP Filing](reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Mobile phone number verification for ICP Filing.md#).


The local communications administration may take 3 to 20 workdays to review your ICP Filing information.

The review result is sent to you by a text message and an email. You can view your ICP Filing status on the [ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/index).

After your ICP Filing information passes the local communications administration review, you can resolve you domain name and direct it to your Alibaba Cloud server.
