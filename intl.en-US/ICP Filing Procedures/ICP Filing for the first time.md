-   You will receive emails and text notifications about the review results. Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/index) to check the ICP Filing status.
-   The review process usually takes 3 to 20 working days after your application documents are submitted.

    **Note:**
