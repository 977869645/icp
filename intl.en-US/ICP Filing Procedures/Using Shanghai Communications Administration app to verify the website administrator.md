# Using Shanghai Communications Administration app to verify the website administrator {#concept_twy_4rl_zdb .concept}

Shanghai Communications Administration requires that ICP Filing applicants in Shanghai must use Shanghai Communications Administration app \(only available in Chinese\) to verity the website administrator.

Shanghai Communications Administration also requires that the photo for verification must be taken in Shanghai, and the mobile phone number used in verification is the mobile phone number of the website administrator in the ICP Filing information.   Allow the app to access your location when installing it.

The procedure is as follows:

1.  After your ICP Filing information passes Alibaba Cloud review, log on to the [ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/)，and use the mobile phone app to scan the QR code on the page \(We recommend you use Alipay or DingTalk to scan the QR code. Scanning with WeChat is not supported\) to  download the installation file.
