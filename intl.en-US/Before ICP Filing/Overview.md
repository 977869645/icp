# Overview {#concept_w3d_nql_zdb .concept}

For quick application of an Internet Content Provider \(ICP\) filing, we recommend that you make adequate preparations before submitting an application.

## Read and understand the MIIT ICP regulations {#section_17y_evw_1bg .section}

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\) has different regulations and requires different documents for ICP filing applications in different provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities of China. We recommend that you read and understand the [MIIT ICP regulations](https://beian.aliyun.com/?spm=a2c4g.750001.765261.5.GoB9kU#MapDataContainer) of different provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, or you can learn about the regulations on [http://www.beian.miit.gov.cn](http://www.beian.miit.gov.cn) \(available in Chinese only\).

## Prepare and check the website domain name {#section_qjf_lxl_zdb .section}

You must specify the domain name of your website when you apply for an ICP filing. The domain name must meet the following requirements:

**Note:** The Alibaba Cloud international site \(alibabacloud.com\) provides domain name registration services for domains whose servers are not located in Mainland China. Therefore, if domain names are registered on the Alibaba Cloud international site \(alibabacloud.com\), you cannot apply for an ICP filing. If you need to use a domain name that is qualified for an ICP filing, register the domain name on the Alibaba Cloud China site \(aliyun.com\).

-   The top-level domain has been approved by MIIT.
-   The domain name is valid.
-   The domain name registrar has been approved by MIIT.
-   Individual entities must be the owner of the website. Organization entities can be the organization, shareholder, senior executive, or the person in charge.
-   You have completed real-name verification for the domain name. For more information about real-name verification for a domain name registered through Alibaba Cloud, see [Real-name verification overview](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/35881.html) and [FAQ about real-name verification](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/41880.html) \(available in Chinese only\). If your domain name is not registered through Alibaba Cloud, consult the domain name registrar for more information.
-   The entity information that you specify in the ICP filing information must be consistent with the real-name verification information of the domain name holder. Verify that the following information is consistent: name, certificate type, and certificate number.

For more information, see [Prepare and check the website domain name](intl.en-US/Before ICP Filing/Prepare and check the website domain name.md#).
