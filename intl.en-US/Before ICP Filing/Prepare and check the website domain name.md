# Prepare and check the website domain name {#concept_n3y_vrl_zdb .concept}

Before applying for an Internet Content Provider \(ICP\) filing, prepare and check the domain name of your website to make sure that the domain name meets the requirements. This helps you pass the verification of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\) and quickly obtain an ICP filing.

**Note:** If your domain name is not registered through Alibaba Cloud but your website is hosted in an Alibaba Cloud instance that is located in Mainland China, you can apply for an ICP filing in the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system. To apply for an ICP filing for the domain name, make sure that the domain name meets the requirements described in this topic.

Check the following items and make sure that your domain name meets the ICP filing requirements:

-   Check item 1: [Real-name verification information of the domain name](#section_9yx_nd1_apx)
-   Check item 2: [Whether your domain name is qualified for an ICP filing](#section_33l_v6o_bla)
-   Check item 3: [Check whether your domain name registrar has been approved by MIIT.](#section_hh2_3e7_3m8)

## Real-name verification information of the domain name {#section_9yx_nd1_apx .section}

Domain names for which real-name verification has not been completed cannot obtain an ICP filing. Make sure that you have completed real-name verification for your domain name and the real-name verification information is consistent with the ICP filing information. If your domain name is registered through Alibaba Cloud, you can perform the following steps to view the real-name verification information.

**Note:** The Alibaba Cloud international site \(alibabacloud.com\) provides domain name registration services for domains whose servers are not located in Mainland China. Therefore, if domain names are registered on the Alibaba Cloud international site \(alibabacloud.com\), you cannot apply for an ICP filing. If you need to use a domain name that is qualified for an ICP filing, register the domain name on the Alibaba Cloud China site \(aliyun.com\).

1.  View the real-name verification information.

    1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud Domain console](https://netcn.console.aliyun.com/core/domain/list).
    2.  On the **Domain Names** page, find the target domain name and click **Manage** in the **Actions** column.

        **Note:** If you cannot find the target domain name after logging on to the Alibaba Cloud Domain console, the domain name may be under another Alibaba Cloud account. For more information about how to find the account that holds the domain name, see [Find the account that holds a domain name](https://help.aliyun.com/knowledge_detail/51187.html) \(available in Chinese only\).

    3.  On the **Basic Information** page that appears, view the real-name verification information.
2.  Optional. Transfer the domain name.

    If the domain name holder information is inconsistent with the entity information, you can transfer the domain name to the entity to keep the information consistent. For more information, see [../../../../../dita-oss-bucket/SP\_119/DNDOMAIN19100060/EN-US\_TP\_14320.md\#](../../../../../intl.en-US/Domain name management/Change domain information/Domain name management overview.md#).

3.  Optional. Complete real-name verification.

    If you have not completed real-name verification for your domain name, complete the process before you apply for an ICP filing. For more information, see [Real-name verification for domains](https://help.aliyun.com/knowledge_detail/35881.html) \(available in Chinese only\).

    **Note:** After you complete real-name verification, it takes about three days to synchronize the real-name verification information to the MIIT database. We recommend that you wait for three days and then apply for an ICP filing after real-name verification is completed. Otherwise, you may fail to obtain an ICP filing due to the lack of real-name verification information in the MIIT database.

4.  Optional. Renew the domain name.

    If your domain name has expired, you must renew the domain name before you apply for an ICP filing. For more information, see [../../../../../dita-oss-bucket/SP\_119/DNDOMAIN19100060/EN-US\_TP\_14326.md\#](../../../../../intl.en-US/Domain name management/Renew domain names/Renew a domain name.md#).


## Whether your domain name is qualified for an ICP filing {#section_33l_v6o_bla .section}

Top-level domain names that are not approved by MIIT cannot obtain an ICP filing. Country code domain names and domain names that are not hosted in Mainland China do not require an ICP filing. Before you apply for an ICP filing, you can perform the following steps to check whether your domain name is qualified for an ICP filing.

1.  Check whether the domain name has been approved by MIIT.
    1.  Visit the [MIIT website](http://域名.信息) \(available in Chinese only\).
    2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Approved Domain Name Authorities**.
    3.  Approved top-level domains are listed in the **Business Scope** column. You can check whether the top-level domain of your domain name is included.

        If the top-level domain of your domain name is not listed in the **Business Scope** column, your domain name cannot obtain an ICP filing.

2.  Check whether your domain name is a second-level domain name.

    Websites whose domain names are directed to servers located in Mainland China must have an ICP filing. After the top-level domain of your domain name obtains an ICP filing, the second-level domains and sub-domains using this top-level domain become accessible. You do not need to apply for an ICP filing for these domain names.

    -   If the ICP filing of your top-level domain is not obtained through Alibaba Cloud, you must add Alibaba Cloud to the service provider list in the ICP filing information. You can add multiple service providers to the ICP filing information of a top-level domain.
    -   According to MIIT regulations, websites using a top-level domain that does not have an ICP filing cannot provide services. Only after the top-level domain obtains an ICP filing, the second-level domains and sub-domains using the top-level domain are allowed to provide services.

## Check whether your domain name registrar has been approved by MIIT. {#section_hh2_3e7_3m8 .section}

If your domain name registrar has not been approved by MIIT, you must transfer the domain name to an approved registrar before you apply for an ICP filing. You can perform the following steps to check whether your registrar has been approved by MIIT, and transfer your domain name to Alibaba Cloud as required.

1.  View the domain name registrar information.

    On the [WHOIS](https://whois.aliyun.com/) page, enter the domain name you want to search for in the text box and click **Search**. This allows you to view the information of the domain name registrar.

2.  Check whether the registrar has been approved by MIIT.

    1.  Visit the [MIIT website](http://域名.信息) \(available in Chinese only\).
    2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Approved Domain Name Registrars**.
    3.  Domain name registrars that have been approved by MIIT are listed in the **Company Name** column. You can check whether your registrar is included.

        If your domain name registrar is not listed in this column, you must transfer your domain name to a registrar that has been approved by MIIT, for example, Alibaba Cloud.

3.  Optional. Transfer the domain name to a registrar that has been approved by MIIT.
