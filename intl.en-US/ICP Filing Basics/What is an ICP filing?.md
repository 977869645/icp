# What is an ICP filing? {#concept_nx4_hql_zdb .concept}

According to the *Administrative Measures for Internet Information Services* and *Measures for the Archival Administration of Non-operational Internet Information Services,* China mandates an Internet Content Provider \(ICP\) filing system for non-commercial Internet information services and an ICP licensing system for commercial Internet information services. Websites that have not obtained an official ICP filing or license are prohibited from operating Internet information services. Therefore, all websites that provide services to Mainland China must first obtain an ICP filing. You can apply for an ICP filing, modify ICP filing information, cancel an ICP filing, and claim an ICP filing in the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system.

## Overview of the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system {#sec_01 .section}

As shown in the following figure, websites that are built to provide services for users involve the following information: instance and access information, website information, and entity information. To apply for an ICP filing, you must submit the preceding information to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\) so that it can verify the authenticity and security of the services provided by your website.

Alibaba Cloud provides the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system to help you apply for an ICP filing, modify ICP filing information, cancel an ICP filing, and claim an ICP filing. You can access the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system from a PC or the Alibaba Cloud app.

-   Apply for an ICP filing

    If you need to apply for an ICP filing for a website, you can purchase an Alibaba Cloud instance that is located in Mainland China and log on to the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/index.htm) from a PC or the Alibaba Cloud app \(available in Chinese only\). You can then apply for an ICP filing in the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system.

    For more information about the procedure and ICP filing types, see [Quick Start](../intl.en-US/ICP Quick Start/Quick Start.md#). For more information about applying for an ICP filing on a PC, see the [ICP filing procedure \(PC\)](https://help.aliyun.com/knowledge_detail/36922.html)in the ICP filing documentation \(available in Chinese only\). For more information about applying for an ICP filing in the Alibaba Cloud app, see in the ICP filing documentation[ICP filing procedure \(app\)](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/112302.html) \(available in Chinese only\).

-   Modify ICP filing information and cancel an ICP filing
    -   Modify ICP filing information

        **Modify ICP filing information**: If you need to modify ICP filing information, such as the entity and website information after you have obtained an ICP filing, you can submit an application in the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system.

    -   Cancel an ICP filing and remove Alibaba Cloud as a service provider
        -   **Cancel an ICP filing**: If you no longer need to use the website that has obtained an ICP filing in the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system, you must cancel the ICP filing by deleting the website or entity information.
        -   **Remove Alibaba Cloud as a service provider**: By removing Alibaba Cloud as a service provider from the ICP filing information, you disassociate the ICP filing information from Alibaba Cloud. We recommend that you add the new service provider to the ICP filing information before you remove Alibaba Cloud as a service provider.

            **Note:** If you remove the current service provider before you add the new service provider, the ICP filing of your website may become invalid. Therefore, you must add the new service provider as soon as possible.

-   Other services
    -   **Claim an ICP filing**: If you have obtained an ICP filing by using the HiChina ICP Filing system before June 2010, and you have not added any other service providers to the ICP filing information or imported the ICP filing information to your Alibaba Cloud account, you must claim the ICP filing.
    -   If you have submitted an ICP filing application between June 1, 2010 and January 31, 2017, you only need to **import the ICP filing information to your Alibaba Cloud account**. You do not need to claim the ICP filing. After you import the ICP filing information, you can continue to apply for the ICP filing in the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/index.htm) \(available in Chinese only\).
