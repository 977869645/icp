# Preparation for ICP Filing {#concept_w3d_nql_zdb .concept}

To save time, we recommend that you keep all the necessary materials ready in advance. As different provinces have different requirements, you must prepare corresponding materials according to the local [ICP Filing rules](https://beian.aliyun.com/?spm=a2c4g.750001.765261.5.GoB9kU#MapDataContainer) \(only available in Chinese\).

## Necessities for ICP Filing {#section_qjf_lxl_zdb .section}

-   Domain Name

    You must register domain names from China-based domain name providers. The domain name verification is successful only when the domain name information meet the MIIT requirements. For more information about domain name requirements, see [Domain name information verification](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/Domain name information verification.md#) and [Domain name FAQs](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/Domain name FAQs.md#).

    **Note:**  Alibaba Cloud International \(alibabacloud.com\) is an international service provider, so domain names registered from Alibaba Cloud International are not supported by the MIIT ICP Filing system. We recommend that you register domain names for ICP Filing from the Chinese site of Alibaba Cloud \(aliyun.com\). The ICP Filing subject must be the domain name owner, whose information is to be verified by the MIIT.

-   Alibaba Cloud ECS instances

    Currently, Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing supports ECS instances with a subscription of three months at least and with Internet bandwidth. If the subscription period of your ECS instances are not long enough, you can renew them to meet the requirement. For more information about ECS instance, see [ECS instance FAQs](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/ECS instance FAQs.md#).

-   Required documents

    -   For individuals: scanned copies or photos of the front and back of ID cards.
    -   For organizations: scanned copies or photos of the company’s registration certificates, and scanned copies or photos of the front and back of the ID cards of the persons in charge of ICP Filing and the websites.
    -   Other documents: other documents required by the local communications administration, such as a domain name certificate. You must upload all the required documents.
