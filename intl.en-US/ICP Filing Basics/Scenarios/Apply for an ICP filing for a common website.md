## Requirements for Applying for an ICP filing for a common website {#section_euq_nhn_wp9 .section}

![Apply for an ICP filing for a common website](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/88723/156749310252276_en-US.png)

In this scenario:

-   Websites hosted on servers located in Mainland China require ICP filings, while websites hosted on servers outside Mainland China do not require ICP filings.
-   The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\) reviews the following information of the website:
    -   Instance and access information:

        MIIT checks whether the website services, instance location, and access method in your ICP filing information meet the requirements. We recommend that you verify your ICP filing information before submitting an ICP filing application. For more information, see [Prepare and check the instance](../../../../reseller.en-US/Before ICP Filing/Host instances and service providers/Prepare and check the instance.md#).

    -   Website information:

        MIIT checks whether the name and content of the website meet relevant requirements and whether the website administrator actually exists. If your website involves information about some special industries, you also need to provide a pre-approval document issued by the relevant government department to prove that the construction of the website has been approved by the department.

        We recommend that you check whether the pre-approval process is required for your website and complete the process as required before submitting an ICP filing application. For more information, see [Pre-approval](../../../../reseller.en-US/Before ICP Filing/Pre-approval.md#).

    -   Entity information:

        MIIT checks whether the organization of your website actually exists and meets relevant requirements. Different types of entities require different materials for identity verification. We recommend that you prepare all the required materials before submitting an ICP filing application. For more information, see [https://help.aliyun.com/knowledge\_detail/36962.html](https://help.aliyun.com/knowledge_detail/36962.html) \(available in Chinese only\).


## Notes for a website that is accessible only through an IP address {#section_hr2_5cj_veg .section}

If a website hosted on a server located in Mainland China is accessible only through an IP address, instead of a domain name, an ICP filing is also required for the website. Currently, you cannot apply for an ICP filing for a website that is accessible only through an IP address in the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system.

**Note:** Do not bring your website online before an ICP filing is obtained, no matter whether your website is accessible through an IP address or a domain name. If you bring your website online before an ICP filing is obtained, your ICP filing application may be rejected by MIIT or your website may be shut down as commanded by MIIT. We recommend that you wait until an ICP filing is obtained.

If your website is accessible only through an IP address, log on to the ICP filing system of the local communications administration office to apply for an ICP filing. For more information about the process, choose **ICP Filing Process** \> **IP Address Filing Process** in the [ICP Filing Management System of MIIT](http://www.beian.miit.gov.cn) \(available in Chinese only\).

## Notes for a website that provides BBS services {#section_vvy_37h_ezn .section}

In the *Decision of the State Council on the Fifth Batch of Items Subject to Administrative Examination and Approval at the Management Level to Be Canceled or Delegated to Lower Level,* Article 7 **Notice of Canceling Special Approval \(Filing\) for Internet Electronic Bulletin Services** regulates that provincial communications administrations shall stop issuing the *BBS Pre-approval Document* required for operating a website that provides bulletin board system \(BBS\) services. Therefore, you cannot apply for an ICP filing for a website that provides BBS services.

## Notes for the HTTP and HTTPS protocols {#section_eym_mzr_zdb .section}

ICP filings are irrelevant to the protocol, HTTP or HTTPS, used by websites. Do not bring your website online before an ICP filing is obtained, no matter whether your website uses HTTP or HTTPS.

For more information about the ICP filing application procedure, see [Quick Start](../../../../reseller.en-US/ICP Quick Start/Quick Start.md#).
