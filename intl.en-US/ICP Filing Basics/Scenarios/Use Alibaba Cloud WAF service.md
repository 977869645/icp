In this scenario:

-   **Do I need to apply for an ICP filing for the domain name?** 

    The website is hosted in an Alibaba Cloud instance located in Mainland China. Therefore, you must apply for an ICP filing for the domain name *www.example.com*. When configuring security protection in Alibaba Cloud WAF, you need to select this domain name with an ICP filing.

-   **Do I need to add Alibaba Cloud to the ICP filing information as a service provider?** 

    The ICP filing information of the domain name must exist in the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system. We recommend that you apply for the ICP filing in the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/selfBaIndex.htm) \(available in Chinese only\).
