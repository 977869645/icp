If any enterprise registered outside Mainland China \(hereinafter referred to as a foreign enterprise\) wants to host a website on a server located in Mainland China, the foreign enterprise needs to apply for an Internet Content Provider \(ICP\) filing for the website. This topic describes the ICP filing requirements for a foreign enterprise.

## ICP filing instructions {#section_60g_kai_ay9 .section}

-   If a foreign enterprise has a branch registered in Mainland China, it can apply for an ICP filing by using the registration certificate of its branch. If a foreign enterprise does not have a branch registered in Mainland China, it must apply to the Administration for Industry and Commerce for a *Registration Certificate of Resident Representative Office of Foreign Enterprise* and use it as a business license to apply for an ICP filing. 

    **Note:** If a foreign enterprise does not have a branch registered in Mainland China but has an office established, it can apply for an ICP filing in the name of this office in some regions of China. However, the foreign enterprise cannot apply for an ICP license in this way.

-   When a foreign enterprise submits an ICP filing application in the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system, the province or city where the application is submitted must be the same as that registered in the registration certificate of the foreign enterprise.
-   The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\) checks whether the website services, instance location, and access method in your ICP filing information meet the requirements. Verify that your ICP filing information meets the requirements before submitting an ICP filing application. For more information, see [Prepare and check the instance](../reseller.en-US/Before ICP Filling/Host instances and service providers/Prepare and check the instance.md#).
