# Use Alibaba Cloud Anti-DDoS Pro {#concept_1181100 .concept}

If your website is hosted in an Alibaba Cloud instance located in Mainland China and uses Alibaba Cloud Anti-DDoS Pro for security protection, you need to use Border Gateway Protocol \(BGP\) lines and add Alibaba Cloud to the ICP filing information as a service provider. This topic describes the ICP filing requirements for using Alibaba Cloud Anti-DDoS Pro.

In this scenario:

-   **Do I need to apply for an ICP filing for the domain name?** 

    The website is hosted in an Alibaba Cloud instance located in Mainland China. Therefore, you must apply for an ICP filing for the domain name *www.example.com*.

-   **Do I need to add Alibaba Cloud to the ICP filing information as a service provider?** 

    When you use Anti-DDoS Pro through BGP lines, the ICP filing information of the domain name must exist in the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system. We recommend that you apply for the ICP filing in the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/selfBaIndex.htm).
