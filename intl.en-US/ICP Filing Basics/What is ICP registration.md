# What is ICP registration {#concept_nx4_hql_zdb .concept}

According to Measures for the Administration of Internet Information Services and Registration Administration Measures for Non-Commercial Internet Information Services, China mandates a filing system for non-commercial Internet information services and a licensing system for commercial Internet information services. Anyone that has not obtained an ICP registration is prohibited from operating Internet information services. Specifically, all websites that provide services to Mainland China must first obtain the ICP registration.

If your website is hosted on an instance deployed within Mainland China or uses CDN nodes within Mainland China, you can apply for ICP registration through the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/selfBaIndex.htm).

**Note:** 

-   If your website provides commercial Internet information services \(for example, providing paid information or web design services to Internet users through the Internet\), you need to apply for an ICP license to activate the services after obtaining ICP registration.
-   According to Administration Measures for the Security Protection of Computer Information Networks Linked to the Internet, you need to go to the [Internet Security Administration Service Platform of the National Public Security Bureau of China](http://www.beian.gov.cn/portal/index?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.1.SRC9LP) and submit a Public Security Bureau \(PSB\) registration application within 30 days after obtaining the ICP registration from Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\).
