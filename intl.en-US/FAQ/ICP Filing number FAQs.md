## What is an ICP number? {#section_hnb_15t_jgb .section}

After you successfully apply for an ICP Filing, the communications administration office assigns a subject ICP number to the entity applying for the ICP Filing, and a website ICP number to the website.

|Type|Format|Â |
|:---|:-----|:-|

|Website ICP number|Abbreviated province name with ICP Filing Subject serial number-Website serial number|Zhe ICP Filing No. 1101xxxx-11|

## Why was my ICP number revoked? {#section_lwp_lvt_jgb .section}

Your ICP number may be revoked in the following situations:

-   The filing subject submits a cancellation application to the administration office or service provider.
-   Your domain name has expired, and the new registrant has submitted a cancellation application to the administration bureau.
-   Your website information is not authentic or accurate, or the ICP Filing information is missing. For example, the filing provider cancels the filing. In this case, the administration bureau will revoke your ICP number.
-   If your website contains illegal information, the administration bureau will revoke your website and subject ICP numbers. In serious cases, the subject information will be blacklisted, and your credential number and website name will be permanently denied for ICP Filing.

## Can I restore my ICP number after it has been revoked by the administration office? {#section_ojn_yvt_jgb .section}

An ICP number cannot be restored once it has been revoked, and the corresponding website cannot be accessed. We recommend that you apply for an ICP Filing for your domain name as soon as possible. Your website will be accessible after the administration bureau completes its review.

## What is the validity period of an ICP number? {#section_z11_dwt_jgb .section}

At present, the administration bureau does not set a validity period for ICP numbers. If your filing information is authentic and accurate, apply for an[ICP Filing change](../../../../../reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Change ICP Filing information.md#) promptly to modify the filing information, or apply for an[ICP Filing](../../../../../reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Transfer ICP Filings.md#) to change to another service provider. Your ICP number is permanently valid if your website content does not involve any illegal content.
