## Do I need to reapply for an ICP Filing when I change my filing information? {#section_imm_bbv_jgb .section}

-   When the information about your website that is filed with Alibaba Cloud is changed, you do not need to reapply for an ICP Filing. Instead, you can [modify the information](../../../../../reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Change ICP Filing information.md#) of the original filing record.

    **Note:** In some provinces, the administration offices do not permit direct modification. In this case, you need to first cancel the original filing record and reapply for the ICP Filing.

-   If you completed the application for a subject filing with a different service provider, you need to change the filing subject with that provider. The changed subject information must be submitted to the administration bureau for review, which takes about 20 work days. Your website continue to operate normally during the review period.
