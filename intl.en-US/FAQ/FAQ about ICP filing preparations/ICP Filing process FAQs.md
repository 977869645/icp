## How do I obtain an ICP Filing for a website that is accessed through an IP address? {#section_bym_mzr_zdb .section}

The Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system does not support ICP Filing for IP addresses. If your website is accessible only through an IP address, log on to the filing system of the local communications administration office to apply for an ICP Filing. For more information about the ICP Filing process, see **ICP Filing Process** \> **IP Address Filing Process** in the [ICP Filing management system of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\).](http://www.miitbeian.gov.cn)

## Is an ICP Filing required if my website domain name points to a server in the Hong Kong region? {#section_cym_mzr_zdb .section}

An ICP Filing is not required if your website domain name points to a server in the Hong Kong region. At present, MIIT only requires ICP Filings for accessible websites that point to servers in Mainland China. ICP Filings are not required for servers located outside Mainland China.

## How do I obtain an ICP Filing for a forum? {#section_dym_mzr_zdb .section}

At present, individuals are not permitted to operate forums. To apply for an ICP Filing for a forum, an enterprise must apply for BBS pre-approval from the local communications administration office and then apply for an ICP Filing. Once these applications are successful, the enterprise can open a forum. Some provinces and municipalities no longer support applications for forums. We recommend that you consult your local provincial communications administration office for more information.

## What are the differences between the ICP Filing application procedures for HTTP and HTTPS websites? {#section_eym_mzr_zdb .section}

The ICP Filing application procedures for HTTP and HTTPS websites are the same. The websites are accessible only after an ICP Filing application is completed. For more information about filing procedures, see the [ICP Filing Guide](../../../../../reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Overview.md#).

## Can enterprises that are registered outside of Mainland China apply for an ICP Filing? {#section_dtz_lvm_jgb .section}

Documents issued outside Mainland China are not accepted for ICP Filing applications.

-   If you have a registered branch company in Mainland China, you can use its registration documents to apply for an ICP Filing.
-   If you do not have a registered company in Mainland China, you need to apply for a **Registration Certificate of Foreign Enterprises Permanent Office in China** from the relevant authority and use this as a business license to apply for an ICP Filing.
