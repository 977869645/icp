## What should I do if I do not know or have stopped using the ICP Filing information specified in the ICP Filing information verification notification that I received from Alibaba Cloud? {#section_wqv_zjm_4gb .section}

If you receive a rectification email and the organizer corresponding to the ICP Filing number does not exist or the website is no longer used, log on to [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing System](https://beian.aliyun.com) to [cancel the ICP Filing](../../../../../reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Cancel an ICP Filing.md#). If your ICP Filing information is not rectified within the specified period, Alibaba Cloud will cancel the ICP Filing transfer of your website, which may affect the normal use of your website.

**Note:** Currently, after the ICP Filing for some domain names is canceled, you cannot apply again for ICP Filing or direct those domain names to servers in Mainland China for access activation. For the suffixes of domain names qualified for ICP Filing, see [Suffixes of domain names that do not support ICP Filing](reseller.en-US/FAQ/Domain name FAQs.md#section_kq2_xls_zdb).

**Note:** When the ICP Filing transfer is successful, [change your ICP Filing information](../../../../../reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Change ICP Filing information.md#) promptly based on the instructions in the rectification email.

## What should I do if my ICP Filing transfer has been canceled because of overdue rectification and the MIIT no longer retains the ICP Filing information due to no post-operations for a long period of time? {#section_vt3_qkm_4gb .section}

If you do not [change your ICP Filing information](../../../../../reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Change ICP Filing information.md#) within the rectification period and have not performed an [ICP Filing transfer](../../../../../reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Transfer ICP Filings.md#) within a long period of time after the cancellation of the ICP Filing transfer, log on to the [MIIT website](http://www.miitbeian.gov.cn/publish/query/indexFirst.action) to check for any subject without website information by using your organizer name.

-   If no ICP Filing information is returned and you still need to use Alibaba Cloud servers in Mainland China, log on to [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing System](https://beian.aliyun.com), click **Start ICP Filing**, and submit related materials based on the [initial ICP Filing](../../../../../reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/ICP Filing for the first time.md#) process. Your website becomes accessible again after your ICP Filing is approved.
