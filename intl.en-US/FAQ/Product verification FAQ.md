# Product verification FAQ {#concept_jyc_xrl_zdb .concept}

When you submit an ICP Filing application through the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system, the system will verify your Alibaba Cloud ECS instances.

## Why did the product verification fail? {#section_ogq_tws_zdb .section}

Your product verification has failed if the following system prompts are displayed after submitting product verification information: 1. "Invalid product information." 2. "ICP filing information already submitted." 3. Other types of system prompts are displayed.

Possible verification failure causes and corresponding solutions are as follows:

-   If the information you entered is invalid, the following system prompt will be displayed: "Invalid product information." In this case, verify if the selected product type matches your purchased product . For an ECS instance, select **Alibaba Cloud** and use the ICP Filing service number for verification.
-   If the number of ICP Filing subjects that can be filed for the current server has reached its limit, the following system prompt will be displayed: "A website ICP Filing application has already been submitted for this product and the number of ICP Filing subjects has reached the limit. Switch to another product." In this case, we recommend that you switch to another ECS instance for product verification.
-   If the ICP Filing service number is invalid, the following system prompt will be displayed: "Product information verification failed. Interface exception." In this case, verify if the server you used to apply for the ICP Filing service number has expired. If the server expires, the service number will become invalid. In this case, apply for an ICP Filing service number using a valid server.
