## Do I need to reapply for an ICP Filing when I change my ICP Filing information? {#section_imm_bbv_jgb .section}

-   When the information about your website that is filed with Alibaba Cloud is changed, you do not need to reapply for an ICP Filing. Instead, you can [change the ICP Filing information](../../../../../intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Change ICP Filing information.md#) about the original record.

    **Note:** In some provinces and municipal cities, the communications administration offices do not permit direct modifications. In this case, you need to first cancel the original ICP Filing record and then apply for another one.

-   If you completed the application for a subject filing with a different service provider, you need to change the filing subject with that provider. The changed subject information must be submitted to the communications administration office for review, which takes about 20 work days. Your website continues to operate normally during the review period.
