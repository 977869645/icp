## How do I apply for a photo backdrop? {#section_rb4_cht_zdb .section}

The Ministry of Industry and Industry Technology \(MIIT\) of China requires the administrator of a website to provide a facial photo for verification during the ICP Filing. After your application passes preliminary review by Alibaba Cloud, you must log on to the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/) and follow the prompts to apply for a backdrop.

**Note:** Backdrops are mailed to addresses in mainland China only. Be sure to enter the correct contact number and address.
