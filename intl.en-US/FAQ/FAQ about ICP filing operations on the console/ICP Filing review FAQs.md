## What should I do once my application passes the preliminary review? {#section_kxv_kjt_zdb .section}

After your application passes the preliminary review, log on to the[ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/) for information on how to proceed, because different communications administration offices have different requirements.

You must provide a photo of the website owner as required.

-   If you already have photos taken against a backdrop, you can upload the photos once the preliminary review is passed.
-   If you do not have a backdrop, you can apply for a backdrop after the preliminary review is passed. After you receive a backdrop, you can take photos and upload them.

**Note**:

-   Users in Shanghai are requested to download the Shanghai administration bureau application on the prompt page, and provide a photo of the verification form of the website owner. For more information, see [Verify website owners by using an application for users in Shanghai](../../../../../reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Using Shanghai Communications Administration app to verify the website administrator.md#).
-   If the system prompts that you must mail the verification materials, mail these materials according to the requirements displayed. After these materials are received, they will be entered into the system for review in one to two working days.
