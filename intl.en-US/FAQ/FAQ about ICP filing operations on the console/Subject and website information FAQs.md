## Considerations for administrator information {#section_ywy_vys_zdb .section}

-   **Email address**: Enter a valid email address which can be accessed and can receive emails.
-   **Credential type**: ID card, mainland travel permit for Taiwan residents, passport, military ID.
-   **Credential number**: Enter the number displayed on the selected credential.
-   **Office phone number**: Phone number format: 086-area code-phone number \(for example, 086-0535-6700763\). The office phone number must be consistent with the location of the contact address. \(This item must be carefully checked. The area code must correspond to the contact address.\)  For personal websites, you can enter a home phone number as the office phone number.
-   Mobile phone number: You must enter a valid mobile phone number that can be used to contact the ICP Filing administrator. During the ICP Filing verification, reviewers may give you a call and confirm the information with you. Therefore, you must provide a valid phone number.

## Do I have to enter the legal representative as the website administrator? {#section_sxd_kvr_zdb .section}

The website administrator must be the actual person in charge of the website. In a later stage, the website administrator must upload authentic photos for verification.

If it is not convenient for the legal representative to undergo photo verification, another person can be entered as the website administrator. However, some provinces/municipalities require that, if the website administrator is not the legal representative, you must submit a letter of authorization from the legal representative. This letter must be uploaded in the same image as the website administrator’s credentials. You can download a letter of authorization template from the website of your local authority, or see [Download letters of authorization](../../../../../reseller.en-US/Download Files/Download legal representative authorization letter template.md#). You must first review the [ICP Filing rules](https://beian.aliyun.com/#MapDataContainer) for your specific province/municipality.

## Can I submit ICP Filing applications for multiple websites at the same time? {#section_txd_kvr_zdb .section}

The number of applications you can submit at the same time varies with the type of ICP Filing.

-   First ICP Filing and Add new website for ICP Filing \(when the original filing is with Alibaba Cloud\): You can submit ICP Filing applications for multiple websites at the same time. After entering the information for one website, click **Save, and Add Another Website** at the bottom of the page to add other websites.
-   Add new website for ICP Filing \(when the original filing is not with Alibaba Cloud: You are only allowed to submit an ICP Filing application for one website because your subject information is not in Alibaba Cloud. After the new website is approved, you can apply for multiple website ICP Filings under this ICP Filing number.
-   Transfer an ICP Filing: This operation transfers an ICP Filing subject’s filings from another service provider to Alibaba Cloud. You can submit an application to transfer multiple websites under the same ICP Filing number. For example, assume you have the ICP Filing numbers Zhejiang ICP Filing 1200000 -1 and Zhejiang ICP Filing 1200000 -2. After entering the information of the “-1” website, you can click **Transfer Another ICP Filing** to transfer another ICP Filing.
