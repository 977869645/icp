## Upload documents with the Alibaba Cloud application and verify the website owner. {#section_cfv_rbt_zdb .section}

Using the Alibaba Cloud application, you can upload ICP Filing documents and verify the website owner at the same time. Currently, you can upload filing documents and verify the website owner identity by using the Alibaba Cloud application \(version 3.16.0 or later\) in some provinces, including Guangdong, Chongqing, Liaoning, Anhui, and Fujian. The date of availability for this capability in other provinces is to be determined. Your filing materials can be submitted to the administration office as early as on the same day. This shortens the website filing application time and improves the filing application efficiency.

The verification process in the Alibaba Cloud application is as follows:

1.  In the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](http://beian.aliyun.com/), enter the filing information and select **Use Alibaba Cloud Application to Upload** to upload filing documents.

2.  Download and install the Alibaba Cloud application. Then, in the application, scan the QR code of your ICP Filing order in the **Upload with Alibaba Cloud Application** section of the Upload Documents page.

    Method 1: Open the Alibaba Cloud application and choose **Console** \> **Website ICP Filing** \> **Scan Order QR Code**.

3.  Take photos of the documents required for verification and then upload them.

    **Note:** To improve the pass rate of the initial review, we recommend that you dress neatly and use a white backdrop when using the application for facial recognition.

## Why can I not upload document images? {#section_x2v_rbt_zdb .section}

If you cannot upload images of your documents, check that the images are in the correct size and format.

-   Accepted formats are .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, or .png.
-   The size of a single image must be no greater than 4 MB.

If the images are in the correct format and size but the problem persists, we recommend that you clear your browser cache or try using a different web browser.

## Considerations for completing the authenticity verification form {#section_z2v_rbt_zdb .section}

Click **Download** to download the form and print a copy. After completing this form, either scan it or take a photo of it and upload the image to the system for review.

Use a black ink pen to complete the form. See [Sample for organizations](http://gtms02.alicdn.com/tps/i2/TB1f.iSJVXXXXXkXFXX6HFAMXXX-1240-1980.jpg) and [Sample for individuals](http://gtms03.alicdn.com/tps/i3/TB11nCSJVXXXXcIXpXXBkJCMXXX-1240-1993.jpg) for details about completing the form.

The requirements may vary across different local communications administrations. For this reason, read the [Rules](https://beian.aliyun.com/#MapDataContainer) carefully.

**Note:** 

-   For organizations: All local communications administration offices require that the authenticity verification form of an organization be stamped with the organization's official seal.

-   For individuals: Jiangxi and Xinjiang offices require that for individual ICP Filing, the website owner must sign and stamp the authentication form with their fingerprint. In other regions, individuals are required to clearly sign the form.

-   Form-filling rules for [Guangdong](http://gtms04.alicdn.com/tps/i4/TB1OyC0JVXXXXaaXpXXA9lwMXXX-1240-1958.jpg) are different from those for the [other provinces](http://gtms01.alicdn.com/tps/i1/TB1hY54JVXXXXc6XXXX9vlzMXXX-1240-1974.jpg). In Guangdong, if the ICP registration subject is an individual, this person must make the following declaration on the form: "I have completed facial verification for ICP registration and I declare that the ICP registration information and verification record are real and valid. I confirm that this website is a personal website, and contains no information pertaining to companies, organizations, or other non-personal websites. I agree that I will promptly update the ICP registration information in the event of any changes. If I have entered false ICP registration information, or have failed to complete the ICP change procedures, or have provided services outside of the scope of this ICP registration, I accept that my website may be shut down and my ICP Filing revoked \(and blacklisted\), among other possible consequences."

-   When applying for ICP Filing for multiple domain names in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, Hainan, Sichuan, or Chongqing, fill in the domain names in one ICP Filing verification form. If the space is insufficient to accommodate all the domain names, you can fill in them in the area below, next to the subject information verification content, or above the website owner name.

    When applying for ICP Filing in Jiangxi, Gansu, or Hunan, fill in all the domain names in the website domain name area. If the space is insufficient to accommodate all the domain names, use the verification form with a widened domain name filling area.

    When applying for ICP Filing in other provinces, you can attach a domain name list \(such as an empty A4 paper\) to the verification form and affix the company stamp to the list. Meanwhile, request the website owner to sign his/her name for personal filing.


## How do I upload a letter of authorization and other materials? {#section_bfv_rbt_zdb .section}

If you are required to upload a letter of authorization or other documents according to the [Rules](https://beian.aliyun.com/#MapDataContainer) of the local communications administration, you can put these documents in the same image and upload them together. For example, you can place the organization name change certificate in the same image as the business license, or put the letter of authorization in the same image as the website owner’s ID documents.

## How do I upload proof and authorization letters using the Alibaba Cloud application? {#section_e3n_5ft_zdb .section}

You can use the application to upload your ID documents, domain name certificates, and authenticity statements. We recommend that you upload any other required special documents from your computer.

## If my ICP Filing application is rejected, must I use the Alibaba Cloud application to upload documents again? {#section_f3n_5ft_zdb .section}

After your ICP Filing order is returned to the draft status, you can select the upload method you want to use again.
