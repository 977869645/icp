This topic describes the reasons and solutions for domain name verification failure.

## Your domain name does not exist in the domain name registrar's library {#section_kpb_q1c_5gb .section}

The reasons and solutions are as follows if you receive the email notification **Domain name verification failed. The domain name is xxxx.com \(domain name does not exist in the domain name registrar's library\)**:

Reason 1: You have not completed real-name authentication for your domain name.

Solution: Complete real-name authentication for your domain name and make sure the information is consistent with the information of the ICP Filing organizer or subject.

-   If you are an Alibaba Cloud domain name user, log on to the [Alibaba Cloud Domain console](https://netcn.console.aliyun.com/core/domain/list) and complete real-name authentication.
-   If you are not an Alibaba Cloud domain name user, contact your domain name registrar.

Reason 2: You have completed real-name authentication for your domain name, but it has not been recorded in the MIIT system. The recording of real-name authentication information for your domain name takes about three to five work days.

Solution: Submit an ICP Filing application within three to five work days after the real-name authentication for your domain name is completed.

## The name of the domain name registrant is not the same as that of the organizer {#section_grp_bbc_5gb .section}

If you receive the following email notification:

1.  **The information of the domain name registrant is not the same as that of the ICP Filling subject. Please verify the authenticity.**
2.  **After system verification, the registrant of the newly added website is XXX, which is inconsistent with the name of the ICP Filing subject or legal representative. Please provide evidentiary materials and domain name authorization statements.**

Reason: Your ICP Filing subject information or organizer information is inconsistent with the domain name real-name authentication information.

Solution: Change the information of the registrant or the ICP Filing subject to make sure they are the same.
