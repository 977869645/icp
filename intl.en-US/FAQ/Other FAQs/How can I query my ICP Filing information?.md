# How can I query my ICP Filing information? {#concept_zlv_btl_zdb .concept}

You can query your ICP Filing records on Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system or the MIIT ICP Filing system \(only available in Chinese\).

-   Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/) with the account you used for the ICP Filing, and you can view the subject and website information you have submitted on the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system.

-   On Public Query page of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\) website \(www.miitbeian.gov.cn\), 

    you can enter the website domain name, document number, ICP Filing subject name, or other information to find matching ICP Filing records. If your new domain name already has an ICP Filing number, you can query the basic ICP Filing information on the Public Query page of MIIT system. You cancel the ICP Filing  by the [Offline cancel](../../../../../reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Cancel an ICP Filing.md#) method, and then apply for an new ICP Filing number.

    **Note:** 

    -   If you cannot access the MIIT website temporarily, try again later, or you can try the local administration website.
    -   You can query the basic ICP Filing information, such as the ICP Filing number, and the province to be filed with,  but you cannot obtain more detailed information.
