# Website construction proposal {#concept_akm_pgm_zdb .concept}

According to the Guangdong provincial authority, domain names with different prefixes \(for example, abc.com and 123.com are domain names with different prefixes\) must be filed as different websites. If multiple domain names are under the same ICP filing entity \(including domain names that have been filed and the domain names to be filed\), such an entity needs to provide the website construction proposal.

-   ICP filing for enterprises:

    If there are 32 or more different domain name prefixes, you need to provide the website construction proposal for each domain name and the Alibaba Cloud letter of guarantee stamped with the ICP filing seal.

-   ICP filing for individuals:

    If there are 6 or more different domain name prefixes, you need to provide the website construction proposal for each domain name. If there are 10 or more different domain name prefixes, you need to provide the website construction proposal for each domain name and the Alibaba Cloud letter of guarantee stamped with the ICP filing seal.
