# Apply for service identification numbers {#concept_z4d_drl_zdb .concept}

A service identification number is the verification code associated with a specific Alibaba Cloud instance that hosts the website. Before you apply for an ICP filing in the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system, you must obtain a service identification number for each website. You can apply for the different numbers of service identification numbers for each supported instance according to the instance type. This topic describes how to apply for service identification numbers after you purchase an instance.

## Notes {#section_h7r_j89_8rc .section}

-   You can apply for service identification numbers for supported instances only. Service identification numbers are used to register an ICP filing. For more information about supported instances and the number of identification numbers that you can apply for according to each instance type, see [Supported instances](intl.en-US/Before ICP Filling/Host instances and service providers/Prepare and check the instance or server.md#table_bob_0qy_xzo).
-   If you use the same Alibaba Cloud account to purchase the instance and register an ICP filing, you can directly select the instance that needs an ICP filing during the registration process. You do not need to apply for a service identification number. You can directly select the instance or apply for a service identification number for registering an ICP filing. The number of websites supported by each instance remains the same no matter which method you choose.
-   If you use separate Alibaba Cloud accounts to purchase the instance and register an ICP filing, we recommend that you use the account that is used to purchase the instance to log on to the Alibaba Cloud console and apply for a service identification number. For more information, see [Procedure](#section_c3r_j3z_zdb).
-   To register an ICP filing, you must apply for a service identification number first. If you have used the service identification number before, you cannot reuse it to apply for another ICP filing. After you cancel an ICP filing or remove a service provider from the registration information, the service identification number is still considered used. You cannot reuse it to register an ICP filing for another website.
