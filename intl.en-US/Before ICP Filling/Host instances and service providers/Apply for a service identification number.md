# Apply for a service identification number {#concept_z4d_drl_zdb .concept}

A service identification number associates the website for which you want to apply for an Internet Content Provider \(ICP\) filing with the instance that hosts the website. When applying for an ICP filing in the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system, you must provide a service identification number for each website. The number of service identification numbers that can be applied for each supported Alibaba Cloud instance varies depending on its type. This topic describes how to apply for a service identification number after you purchase an instance.

## Precautions {#section_h7r_j89_8rc .section}

-   You can apply for service identification numbers for supported instances only. Service identification numbers are used to apply for ICP filings. For more information about supported instances and the number of service identification numbers that can be applied for each instance type, see [Supported instances](reseller.en-US/Before ICP Filling/Host instances and service providers/Prepare and check the instance.md#table_bob_0qy_xzo).
-   If you use the same Alibaba Cloud account to purchase the instance and apply for an ICP filing, you can directly select the instance during the ICP filing application process. You do not need to apply for a service identification number separately. You can directly select the instance or apply for a service identification number to apply for an ICP filing. In either method, one service identification number quota will be consumed for the instance.
-   If you use separate Alibaba Cloud accounts to purchase the instance and apply for an ICP filing, we recommend that you use the account that is used to purchase the instance to log on to the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing Management console and apply for a service identification number. For more information, see [Procedure](#section_c3r_j3z_zdb).
-   To apply for an ICP filing, you must provide a service identification number. If you have used a service identification number to apply for an ICP filing, you cannot reuse it to apply for another ICP filing. After you cancel the ICP filing or remove a service provider from the ICP filing information, the service identification number is still considered used. You cannot reuse it to apply for an ICP filing for another website.

    **Note:** 

    If the **Apply** button is not displayed in the Operation column for an instance, the instance is not qualified for ICP filing application. For more information, see [Prepare and check the instance](reseller.en-US/Before ICP Filling/Host instances and service providers/Prepare and check the instance.md#).

4.  In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

    **Note:** To view the service identification number that you have obtained, click ICP No. Management in the left-side navigation pane. All service identification numbers are listed on the ICP No. Management page.
