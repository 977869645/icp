# Prepare and check the website domain {#concept_n3y_vrl_zdb .concept}

Before you apply for an ICP filing, prepare and check the domain name of your website to make sure that the domain name meets the requirements. This helps you pass the MIIT verification and quickly obtain an ICP filing.

Check the following items and make sure that the domain name meets the requirements:

-   Check item 1: [Real-name verification information](#section_9yx_nd1_apx)
-   Check item 2: [Check whether your domain name is qualified for an ICP filing](#section_33l_v6o_bla)
-   Check item 3:[Confirm whether your domain name registrar has been approved by MIIT](#section_hh2_3e7_3m8)

## Check the real-name verification information of the domain name {#section_9yx_nd1_apx .section}

Domain names that have not completed the real-name verification process cannot obtain an ICP filing. Make sure that you have completed the real-name verification process for your domain name and the real-name verification information is consistent with the ICP registration information. If your domain name is registered through Alibaba Cloud, you can perform the following steps to view the real-name verification information.

**Note:** The Alibaba Cloud International Site \(www.alibabacloud.com\) provides domain name registration services for domains whose servers are not located in Mainland China. Therefore, if domain names are registered on the Alibaba Cloud International Site, you cannot apply for an ICP filing. If you need to register a domain name that can obtain an ICP filing, register the domain name on the Alibaba Cloud China Site \(www.aliyun.com\).

1.  View the real-name verification information

    1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud Domain](https://netcn.console.aliyun.com/core/domain/list) console.
    2.  On the **Domain Names** page, find the target domain name and click **Manage** in the **Actions** column.

        **Note:** After you use the current account to log on to the console, if you cannot find the target domain name, the domain name may be under another account.

    3.  The real-name verification information is displayed on the **Basic Information** page.
2.  Transfer the domain name \(optional\)

    If the domain holder information is inconsistent with the entity information, you can transfer the domain name to the entity to keep the information consistent. For more information, see [../../../../../dita-oss-bucket/SP\_119/DNDOMAIN19100060/EN-US\_TP\_14320.md\#](../../../../../intl.en-US/Domain name management/Domain name management overview.md#).

3.  Real-name verification \(optional\)

    If you have not completed the real-name verification process for the domain name, complete the process before you apply for an ICP filing.

    **Note:** After you complete the real-name verification process, it takes up to three days to synchronize the information to the MIIT database. We recommend that you wait three days and then apply for an ICP after the real-name verification process is completed. Otherwise, you may fail to obtain an ICP filing due to the lack of real-name verification information in the MIIT database.

4.  Renew the domain name \(optional\)

    If your domain name has expired, you must renew the domain name before you apply for an ICP filing. For more information, see [../../../../../dita-oss-bucket/SP\_119/DNDOMAIN19100060/EN-US\_TP\_14326.md\#](../../../../../intl.en-US/Domain name management/Renew a domain name.md#).


## Check whether your domain name is qualified for an ICP filing {#section_33l_v6o_bla .section}

Top-level domains that are not approved by MIIT cannot obtain an ICP filing. Country code domain names and domain names that are not hosted in Mainland China do not require an ICP filing. Before you apply for an ICP filing, you can perform the following steps to check whether your domain name is qualified for an ICP filing.

1.  Check whether the domain name has been approved by MIIT
    1.  Click [域名.信息](http://域名.信息) in a browser.
    2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **域名注册管理机构审批情况**.
    3.  Approved top-level domains are listed in the **业务范围** column. You can check and confirm whether the top-level domain of your domain name is included.

        If the top-level domain of your domain name is not listed in the **业务范围** column, your domain name cannot obtain an ICP filing.

2.  Confirm whether your domain name is a second-level domain name

    Websites whose domain names are resolved to servers located in Mainland China must register an ICP filing. After the top-level domain of your domain name obtains an ICP filing, the second-level domains and subdomains using this top-level domain become accessible. You do not need to apply for an ICP filing for these domain names.

    -   If the ICP filing number of your top-level domain name is not obtained through Alibaba Cloud, you must add Alibaba Cloud to the service provider list in the registration information. You can add multiple service providers to the registration information for the same top-level domain. For more information, see [Add Alibaba Cloud to the registration information](../intl.en-US//Transfer ICP Filings.md#).
    -   According to MIIT regulations, websites using a top-level domain that does not have an ICP filing cannot provide services. Only after the top-level domain obtains an ICP filing, the second-level domains and subdomains using the top-level domain are allowed to provide services. For more information, see [ICP filing procedure](../intl.en-US//ICP Filing for the first time.md#).

## Confirm whether your domain name registrar has been approved by MIIT {#section_hh2_3e7_3m8 .section}

If your domain name registrar has not been approved by MIIT, you must transfer the domain name to an approved registrar before you apply for an ICP filing. You can perform the following steps to check whether your registrar has been approved by MIIT, and transfer your domain name to Alibaba Cloud.

1.  View domain name registrar information

    On the [WHOIS](https://whois.aliyun.com/) page, enter the domain name in the input box and click **Search**. This allows you to view the information of the domain name registrar.

2.  Confirm whether the registrar has been approved by MIIT

    1.  Click [域名.信息](http://域名.信息) in a browser.
    2.  In the left-side navigation, click **域名注册服务机构审批情况**
    3.  Domain name registrars that have been approved by MIIT are listed in the **企业名称** column. You can check and confirm whether your registrar is included.

        If your domain name registrar is not listed in this column, you must transfer your domain name to a registrar that is approved by MIIT. To transfer a domain name to Alibaba Cloud, follow these steps:

3.  Transfer the domain name to a registrar that is approved by MIIT \(optional\)
