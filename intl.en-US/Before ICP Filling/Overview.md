# Overview {#concept_w3d_nql_zdb .concept}

For quick registration of an ICP filing, we recommend that you meet the following requirements.

## Read and understand the ICP regulations {#section_17y_evw_1bg .section}

Administrations of different provinces have different regulations and require different documents. We recommend that you read and understand the [ICP regulations](https://beian.aliyun.com/?spm=a2c4g.750001.765261.5.GoB9kU#MapDataContainer) of different provincial administrations, autonomous regions, and municipalities, or you can learn about the regulations on [http://www.beian.miit.gov.cn](http://www.beian.miit.gov.cn).

## Prepare and check the domain name {#section_qjf_lxl_zdb .section}

You must enter the domain name of your website when you specify the registration information. The domain name must meet the following requirements:

**Note:** The Alibaba Cloud International Site \(www.alibabacloud.com\) provides domain name registration services for domains whose servers are not located in Mainland China. Therefore, if domain names are registered on the Alibaba Cloud International Site, you cannot apply for an ICP filing. If you need to register a domain name that can obtain an ICP filing, register the domain name on the Alibaba Cloud China Site \(www.aliyun.com\).

-   The top-level domain \(TLD\) has been approved by Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\) of the Chinese government.
-   The domain name is valid.
-   The domain name registrar has been approved by MIIT.
-   The owner of the website must be individual entities. Organization entities can be the organization, shareholder, senior executive, or the person in charge.
-   You have completed the real-name verification process for the domain name. For more information about real-name verification, see [Real-name verification overview](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/35881.html) and [Real-name verification failures and solutions](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/41880.html). If your domain name is not provided by Alibaba Cloud, consult the domain name registrar for more information.
-   The information about the entity that you specify in the registration information must be consistent with the information about the domain holder that you specify in the real-name verification information. Verify that the following information is consistent: name, certificate type, and certificate number.
