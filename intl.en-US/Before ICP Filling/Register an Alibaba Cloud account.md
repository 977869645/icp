# Register an Alibaba Cloud account {#concept_xr3_pqx_3hb .concept}

The Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system allows you to apply for an ICP filing, modify registration information, cancel an ICP filing, and claim an ICP filing. When you use the system to apply for an ICP filing, you must register an Alibaba Cloud account first based on the entity information and actual needs. If you need to manage your registration information, use this account to log on to the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system.

## Notes {#section_82a_bao_wga .section}

-   **Each Alibaba Cloud account can register an ICP filing for one entity only \(organization or individual\).** However, each entity can register ICP filings for multiple websites. If you need to register ICP filings for multiple entities, use separate Alibaba Cloud accounts to submit the applications. We recommend that you register an Alibaba Cloud account for each entity, and use the corresponding account to register and manage ICP filings and websites of the entity.
-   If you have obtained an ICP filing for your domain names, enterprise websites, or Taobao shops that use the Winport service through HiChina before January 2019, we recommend that you register a new Alibaba Cloud account and import the registration information to this account. This helps you manage your registration information. You must register an Alibaba Cloud account for each entity. We recommend that you register sufficient Alibaba Cloud accounts based on your actual needs, and import the registration information of the entities to these accounts, respectively.
-   You can use separate Alibaba Cloud accounts to register and manage an ICP filing, and purchase an Alibaba Cloud instance. If your Alibaba Cloud resources and registration information are managed by different administrators, we recommend that you use separate Alibaba Cloud accounts to manage the resources and registration information.
-   ICP filing registration does not require real-name verification. If you need to use the account that is used to register an ICP filing to purchase an Alibaba Cloud service, you must complete the real-name verification process for the account.
