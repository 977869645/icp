# Register an Alibaba Cloud account {#concept_xr3_pqx_3hb .concept}

The Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system allows you to apply for an Internet Content Provider \(ICP\) filing, modify ICP filing information, cancel an ICP filing, and claim an ICP filing. To use the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system to apply for an ICP filing, you must register an Alibaba Cloud account first based on the entity information and actual needs. Later, you can use this account to manage the ICP filing information in the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system.

## Notes {#section_82a_bao_wga .section}

-   **Each Alibaba Cloud account can be used to apply for an ICP filing for only one entity \(organization or individual\).** However, each entity can apply for ICP filings for multiple websites. If you need to apply for ICP filings for multiple entities, use different Alibaba Cloud accounts to submit the applications. We recommend that you register an Alibaba Cloud account for each entity, and use the corresponding account to apply for and manage ICP filings for all the websites of the entity.
-   If you have obtained ICP filings for your domain names, enterprise websites, or Taobao shops that use the Winport service by using the HiChina ICP Filing system before January 2017, we recommend that you register Alibaba Cloud accounts and import the ICP filing information to these accounts. This facilitates the management of your ICP filings. You must register an Alibaba Cloud account for each entity. We recommend that you register sufficient Alibaba Cloud accounts based on your actual needs, and import the ICP filing information of the entities to these accounts, respectively.
-   The Alibaba Cloud account used to apply for and manage ICP filings and the Alibaba Cloud account used to purchase instances do not need to be the same. If your Alibaba Cloud resources and ICP filing information are managed by different persons, we recommend that you use separate Alibaba Cloud accounts to purchase and manage the resources and to manage the ICP filing information.
-   The Alibaba Cloud account used to apply for ICP filings does not require real-name verification. If you also need to use this account to purchase Alibaba Cloud services, you must complete real-name verification for this account.
