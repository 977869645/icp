# Quick Start {#concept_lf1_crl_zdb .concept}

If your website is hosted on a server located in Mainland China, you must apply for an Internet Content Provider \(ICP\) filing based on the ICP filing regulations of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\) in the province, autonomous region, or municipality where you intend to submit the application. If you use an Alibaba Cloud instance that is located in Mainland China, you can apply for an ICP filing by using the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system. You can provide services on your website only after an ICP filing is obtained. This topic describes how to apply for an ICP filing by using the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system.

## Procedure {#section_tcc_bds_s2b .section}

To apply for an ICP filing, you can use the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system on a PC or in the Alibaba Cloud app to submit an ICP filing application.

**Note:** 

-   The Alibaba Cloud app supports intelligent certificate recognition and face recognition. This reduces the time taken and improves efficiency. We recommend that you use the Alibaba Cloud app to apply for an ICP filing.
-   Currently, the Alibaba Cloud app supports only the following ICP filing types: initial ICP filing and new website whose entity information has already been submitted to MIIT. For more information about ICP filing types, see the description at the end of this topic.
-   According to MIIT's requirements on the authenticity of ICP filing applications, you must use the Alibaba Cloud app to upload certificate documents and complete authenticity verification when you apply for an ICP filing on a PC.

The procedures for applying for an ICP filing on a PC and in the Alibaba Cloud app are similar. The following figure shows the procedure on a PC. The differences between the procedures on a PC and in the Alibaba Cloud app will be described in each step.

1.  Preparations
    -   Register an Alibaba Cloud account. Before applying for an ICP filing, you must register an Alibaba Cloud account for submitting the ICP filing application and maintaining ICP filing information later. For more information, see [Register an Alibaba Cloud account](../../../../reseller.en-US/Before ICP Filling/Register an Alibaba Cloud account.md#).

    -   Prepare an instance.

        Purchase an Alibaba Cloud instance that is located in Mainland China or obtain a service identification number for an Alibaba Cloud instance. Then, verify that the instance meets the requirements for applying for an ICP filing. For more information, see [Prepare and check the instance](../../../../reseller.en-US/Before ICP Filling/Host instances and service providers/Prepare and check the instance.md#).

    -   Optional. Complete the pre-approval process.

        You must obtain a pre-approval from the specified authority if your website provides the following information or services: news, publishing, medical devices, culture, broadcasting, films, TV programs, education, medicine, healthcare, car-booking services, and electronic bulletin board services. For more information, see [Pre-approval](../../../../reseller.en-US/Before ICP Filling/Pre-approval.md#).

    -   Learn ICP regulations of MIIT. You must read and understand the MIIT ICP regulations and prepare the ICP filing information as required.

2.  Procedure

    As described in [What is an ICP filing](../../../../reseller.en-US/ICP Filing Basics/What is an ICP filing?.md#), MIIT verifies the following information when you apply for an ICP filing: instance, service provider, website, and entity information. You must submit the required information or documents in the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system.

    1.  **Enter the information required for verifying the ICP filing type.** 

        Enter the entity and website information. The system automatically determines the ICP filing type based on the information you entered.

        **Note:** If you are using the Alibaba Cloud app, you also need to upload the certificate of your organization in this step. If the entity is an individual, you also need to complete authenticity verification.

    2.  **Verify the Alibaba Cloud instance.** 

        Verify the instance that hosts the website.

    3.  **Enter the entity and website information.** 

        Enter the website information and authentic information about the entity. The entity can be an organization or individual.

        **Note:** If you are using the Alibaba Cloud app, you also need to upload the certificates of the entity and website administrator in this step and complete authenticity verification as the entity.

    4.  **Upload materials and complete authenticity verification.** 

        Upload photos or scanned color copies of certificates.

        **Note:** 

        -   If you are using the Alibaba Cloud app, you only need to upload the required auxiliary materials in this step. You do not need to perform authenticity verification again.
        -   Since 29 July 2019, face liveness detection in the Alibaba Cloud app is required when you apply for an ICP filing by using the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system according to MIIT's requirements on the authenticity of ICP filing applications. The original verification method of taking a photo in front of a backdrop is no longer used.
    5.  **Verify the information.** 

        Before submitting the ICP filing application, verify the ICP filing information carefully, including the information about the entity, website, and service provider. After confirming that the information is correct, submit the application.

        **Note:** If you are applying for an ICP filing on a PC, you can verify the information in the Alibaba Cloud app after uploading the required materials. If you cannot log on to the Alibaba Cloud app by using your Alibaba Cloud account, you can return to the PC to verify the information.

    6.  **Alibaba Cloud reviews your ICP filing application.** 

        After you submit the ICP filing application, an Alibaba Cloud ICP filing review specialist will review your ICP filing application.

    7.  **Optional. Mail the materials.** 

        After Alibaba Cloud reviews your ICP filing application, you may be required to mail the materials to a specified address according to the ICP filing regulations of MIIT in certain regions.

    8.  **Optional. Complete SMS verification.** 

        Currently, users from the following provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities must complete SMS verification: Tianjin, Gansu, Tibet, Ningxia, Hainan, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Fujian, Shaanxi, Chongqing, Guangxi, Yunnan, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hunan, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Hubei. Your application can be submitted to MIIT for verification only after you complete SMS verification.

    9.  **MIIT reviews your ICP filing application.** 

        After reviewing your ICP filing application, the Alibaba Cloud ICP filing review specialist will submit the ICP filing application to MIIT for final review. Your ICP filing application is successful after you pass the final review. The review result will be sent to your mobile phone and mailbox.

3.  What's next
    -   Optional. Apply for an ICP license.

        If your website generates income, for example, providing commercial services to customers with information and webpage designs, you must obtain an ICP license after you apply for an ICP filing. You need to apply to the local administration for an ICP license. Alibaba Cloud provides services that help you apply for an ICP license.

    -   Apply for a Public Security Bureau \(PSB\) filing.

        As required by *Measures for Security Protection Administration of the International Networking of Computer Information Networks* , you must log on to [www.beian.gov.cn](http://www.beian.gov.cn/portal/index?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.1.SRC9LP) and apply for a PSB filing within 30 days after you obtain an ICP filing.
